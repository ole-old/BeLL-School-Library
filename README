# About 
This is a work in progress and is not yet at Alpha1.

Based on Mobile Futon (https://github.com/daleharvey/mobilefuton), I placed it the app directory and wired it into a Kanso config file (kanso.json) so it can be deployed using "kanso push http://urlOfyourCouchDBdatabase". The URL of the index is at an awkward path for the moment.

/_design/hammock/app/_attachments/index.html


# Installation
If you are deploying from source you'll need the Kanso scripts which can be acquired from the Node Package Manage (npm).  Kanso will place all of the files in your project in a design document on your specified CouchDB. See http://kan.so/installation for directions on how to get started.
