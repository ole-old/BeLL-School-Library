# The Open Learning Exchange Library App is...

## ... a classroom management tool for teachers to offer students differentiated learning.

The OLE Library App allows teachers to assign Resources to their students and track their progress.  Resources are classified by subject and level, and include a link to interactive HTML5 apps such as the OLE Book Reader app and the Flink Activities App.  The OLE Library App and related HTML5 Apps live on a CouchDB on a School BeLL or other PC broadcasting Wi-Fi to nearby devices with web browsers. 


## ... digital infrastructure for content distribution from a diverse number of sources.

The OLE Library App works on low cost hardware such as the BeLL System and is built on top of Open Source CouchDB which offers an easy way to replicate and distribute content by “piggy-backing” on devices moving between Wi-Fi networks that may or may not have an Internet connection.

The OLE Library App allows for content from multiple publishers and also content creation from within the OLE Library Network which results in a higher quality of educational resources.


## ... a feedback tool to aid in planning curriculum.

Replication of usage data and feedback on educational resources in the OLE Library App gives policy makers, school administrators, coaches, teachers, and students near real-time data to support decision making, transparency, incentives, and accountability.
