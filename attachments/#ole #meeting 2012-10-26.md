 I'm not so much bashing TM as I am pointing out we may end up spending almost all of our time on TM which would be a bummer because it wouldn't advance  


What are the pros of using TM on BeLL as opposed to TM hardware?


- individualized learning
- monitoring for teacher
- feedback for administrators

feedback loop is USP
off the internet, off the grid
scalable


detour wen
we need more money
prove a tool


- set up teachermate OMS and Games (resources) on the BeLL
- Link from My Library to TM OMS
- If it's not a huge project, we automate that login
- capturing the TM Games (resource) usage data, worst case, they were in TM, they werent, better is they were in this resource, even better is they liked it, better yet they flag a standard
- Flink activity data capturing, code for the hook
- Standards browser


- can we have the tablets aggresively try to always join schoolbell network?
- how are we going to get headphones for TM activities?
